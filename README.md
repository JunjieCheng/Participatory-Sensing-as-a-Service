# SLA optimization strategy

## Introduction

I tried couple examples and concluded some typical scenarios for SLA optimization. I hope to define the principle of SLA first, then it will be easy to implement.

In SLA, we need to consider success rate, time cost, incentive cost (money). To optimize the execution flow, we need to not only calculate the possibility distribution of the task, but also balance the success rate, time cost and incentive cost by assigning number tasks to participants. 

Then I will use some examples to explain.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Linear Flow
